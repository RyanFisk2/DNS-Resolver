# DNS-Resolver

## Purpose
This is a very short pythons script that takes domain names from a .txt file (in this case doamins.txt) and resolves a DNS query to get the matching IP. It then writes both the domain name and matching IP to an output .txt file (ips.txt).

## Usage
With domains.txt (the input file) and ips.txt(the output file) in the same directory as dnsResolver.py

Run with
```
python dnsResolver.py
```
